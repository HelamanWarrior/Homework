**Unplugged**

I believe that technology should be used to assist daily life, never to replace it. My relationship with technology is somewhat complex. I utilize it creatively to make video games, animations, and videos. But I realize that even using it in these beneficial ways, it still needs balance. I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life in front of a computer. I try to balance the time I spend in technology with other meaningful beneficial ways. Technology shouldn't replace my face to face conversations and social interactions with people. It's helpful when I can't see the person in real life, but whenever I can, I will always prefer face to face communication. One example of how I use technology to assist my life, is whenever we go on family trips. I enjoy going on adventures and being outside with my family. While doing this I'll shoot handheld and 360 video and make a montage of the trip at the end. In this case technology isn't replacing my reactions in real life, but it's assisting it by creating these memories that we can look back on in the future. Balance is the key. I've been trying to balance the things I make with technology with going outside and being in reality.
