**Why isn't the Sky Blue?**

Our perception of reality is often communicated through words.
Verbal communication is limited by the available words and vocabulary.
We categorize our perceptions into words.
Emotions, feelings, taste, smells, and colors are very difficult to describe.
But once we assign these perceptions a word, it becomes very easy for everyone to understand.
Without words assigned to these perceptions, our communication will be rendered ineffective.
The sky is only blue because we all agreed it is.
Blue was assigned to a group of common colors.
It's impossible to communicate the color of the sky without a common name associated with it.

The colors podcast talked about an experiment.
The experiment presented colors to the people of Namibia; these people didn't have the word blue in their dictionary.
"He sat down with a bunch of members of the Himba tribe, whipped out a laptop, and showed them 12 colored squares. All identical except for one."
Basically all the squares we green, except for one blue square.
They found the distiction between these two different colors a bit difficult.
To us, this may sound crazy; the contrast between the colors is striking enough we see a vast difference.
I don't believe it's as crazy as some may believe.
Let's take for instance, you decide to buy a new car.
After doing so, you begin to notice the same type of car a lot more.
It's not that you didn't see these cars before, you just didn't notice them.
There is contrast, they stick out from the crowd of other cars to you.
The same exact idea rings true here.
When we group our perceptions and senses to words, it's easier to recognize them.
They become more personal to us, like buying a car.

In the book "The Communication Age," it states "The social construction model assumes that we become who we are in relation to others through communication, and that the social world becomes what it is chiefly through the process of communication."
Basically, our communication shapes who we are and the social world around us.
It's crazy to me to think that everything that shapes our reality, isn't real.
Everything we perceive around us is constructed through the way we see the world.
Reality is defined by the common perceptions of society.
If society agrees that a particular part of the color spectrum is blue, society will view the world differently.
We will view the sky and many other elements of the world with similar color as the color blue.
Reality used to be that the Earth was the center of the universe.
This was because of the perception of society.
Everyone percieved the sun and the stars revolving around the Earth.
Since then, our reality has changed.
With advances in technology, we know now that the Earth revolves around the sun and we are not the center of the universe.
Through our perception we corrected our previous idea of reality to our idea of a more accurate representation of reality.
Society has agreed through our perception that the sky is blue.
We created a word assigned to these similar perceptions of color.
These word has affected our social construction of reality.

According to the website "Translation Excellence," there was an experiment done between English and the Jehai speakers. 
"It was discovered that both the English and the Jehai teams were able to quickly and concisely come to an agreement about how to name and describe colors. However, while the Jehai teams were able to do the same with smells– even unfamiliar odors– the English teams took up to five times longer to find responses that described the smell, and frequently were unable to properly identify the source at all." (Translation Excellence, 2014)
This experiment proved that language had the biggest communication impact.
Seemingly obscure senses like smells or tastes, are often described more quickly and efficently in other languages.
If blue wasn't in our vocabulary, then the efficently and effectiveness in describing it would be inferior.
We would have to describe it using similar elements of our perception.
For example I would describe the sky as sapphire.
But in doing so, I have found increased cognitive effort and decreased effectiveness in my communication.
Does the sky look like saphire?
Does the sky reflect light like saphire?
It communicates a vague idea in my perception of the sky.
This is why I believe that words heavily limit our communication.
We have a big enough vocabulary that there is combinations of words that can be substituted to communicate and explain terms like blue.
When society groups our perceptions into words, we can say less but communicate more.
We are all familiar with these perceptions, and we can make the connection to these perceptions with the word.
This lowers the barrier for miscommunication and makes communication much more effective and efficent.

In conclusion, words shape our perception of reality.
When we group our perceptions and senses into words, it's easier to recognize them.
Without blue in our language it would be much more difficult to explain and recognize.
Just like in the example of buying the car, we now recognize the same car much more.
Everything we view around us is reflected by our perception of reality.
Our perception is depicted by others around us.
Society had to agree what blue is based on their own perceptions.
With the common word and perception of blue, now society can better communicate and view it.
