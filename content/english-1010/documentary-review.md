**Eating Our Way to Extinction Analysis**

The documentary *Eating Our Way to Extinction* was released on Earth day in 2021. It claims that society needs to move towards a plant-based diet. Otherwise, society risks climate change, environmental damage, species extinction, hunger, poverty, disease, and antibiotic resistance. Due to the increasing demand for meat, the meat industry expands every year which leads to forests getting destroyed in order to create more room for animal agriculture. In the forest removal process, indigious people are forcibly removed from their land and their villages are burned to the ground. In doing so, many species are dying and on the verge of going extinct. The meat industry also treats animals in a way that allows for diseases to arise. Animals are crammed in small cages and are given many antibiotics. These antibiotics are used to help prevent diseases in the animals. The overuse in antibiotics could lead to them being rendered useless; both for the animals and society. Which leads to mass pandemics and viruses. The documentary concludes that society can fix all of these problems by switching to an exclusively plant based diet.

The film begins in the rainforest, ambience absorbing all sound; only to be broken up by the loud roar of a chainsaw. The tree begins to tilt, sounds of creaking and cracking intensify until it crashes against the rainforest floor. Sound is heavily used to immerse you into the scene and to create a heavy sense of ethos. Aaron Williams from *PagerPower* states, "why the production of sustainable food sources is not being discussed prominently on the world stage, is perhaps best summarized in the opening scene.” In this opening scene, the film interviews an anonymous masked Brazilian about the forced removal of these indiginous people’s homes. He responds, “Why should we give land to the Indians... the whole world thinks they can tell Brazil what to do with her land... no, we do what we please.” Both Aaron and the documentary agree that “It is the economic influences that are restricting this topic from being highlighted more prominently by politicians.” This contributes to the documentary’s claim that the audience needs to switch to an exclusively plant-based diet. It’s inherently out of the interests of the politicians to make a change. The documentary makes a compelling argument which leads the audience to realize that they have to be the ones to make the change. This further persuades the audience because the issue is pushed on to them; it makes the issue more personal. They may realize that society can’t just rely on politicians.

Tejas Yadav from *Spectrum Culture* analyzed the impact of the messages from the indigious people. These people stated, "This is not our forest, we are only a small part of it." The documentary used powerful messages like this that makes the audience reevaluate their role with nature. It makes people question if we have the right for the destruction they inflict on the Earth. In order to back up the points made in the film, they actively interview people from both sides of the coin; people involved in the industry, and the people that are actively affected by the industry. Workers from the livestock industry, the EU commissioner, indiginous people, the head of the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, and a chief scientist were all included in the film’s interviews. All of this gathers critical information from both sides, and adds to the documentary’s credibility, further convincing the audience that the meat industry is a real issue that needs to be resolved.

In conclusion, *Eating Our Way to Extinction* uses phrases that communicate to the audience that we don’t own the nature and forests around us, and questions our rights to destroy them. Its heavy usage of sound creates emotion. The ambient sound of forests, the violent sounds of trees cracking and falling, all come together to connect with the audience emotionally. Interviews were conducted throughout the movie, providing evidence for their argument by using people that are affected by the industry and the people working in the industry. All of which supports the request that society needs to switch to an exclusively plant-based diet. This opens up the question, what would convince society to shift their diet? "There is a possible way forward in the form of individuals making sustainable food choices rather than waiting for politicians to take the lead. Recently McDonald’s has released a ‘McPlant’ burger in the UK; this may be in part due to the rise and popularity of those adopting a plant-based diet or seeking to reduce their consumption of meat." (Aaron) Aaron concludes that having these fast food options would increase the accessibility and convenience of plant-based food. This would encourage and help people to shift their diets much more easily. But even with the variety of options available, the question still remains, would people bother to switch?
