      <description>Recent developments in artificial intelligence have taken the world by storm. Large language models, stable diffusion generative image technologies, and automatic speech recognition neural networks have led to a rise in AI tools and technologies.

My essays lacked a cohesive structure, flow, and my arguments were often weak and not well-supported by evidence.</description>
