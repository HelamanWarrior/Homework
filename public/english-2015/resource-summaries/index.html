  <p><strong>Week 6:</strong>
In the article,”Brief but Extremely Important Introductory Chapter that You Should Definitely Read” by Jay Jordan is all about rhetoric. “Rhetoric is the study and use of symbolic resources (especially language) that help humans cooperate with one another.” Rhetoric is also  extremely helpful in writing, especially when the writer is writing to argue. In this course, argument entails assessing topics, adopting views on them, supporting those positions with arguments and supporting data, and being upfront about your ideas. Although writing is such a broad section, they focus on a general overview of writing so writers can have a good foundation for their writing. Rhetoric can be extremely functional in many ways that can make it effective like placing it in one sentence paragraphs. People use rhetoric their whole lives and this is showing how to apply it to writing.</p>
<p>In the book Information Navigator, “Chapter 3 - Beginning Your Research” analyzes the process of gathering research for an assignment or project. The chapter highlights scholarly communication as a conversation, finding ideas for topics, identifying scope of the project, and formulating a research question or a thesis statement. “Part of what separates good writers from great writers is the ability to organize and relate multiple ideas in one place.” By incorporating multiple sources of information students can create a new conversation; rather than simply summarizing the information of the sources, students can utilize the information from differing sources to offer a new perspective on a topic. The chapter explains that when beginning an assignment or project it’s important to consider the scope in order to determine the type and amount of resources to use.
In the article, “Chapter 1: Choosing and Developing Topics” it reveals the difficulty that people face in choosing simply one source of information to delve into, due to the fact that they are constantly bombarded with different information from differing sources. The article then highlights that great writers can sort through this information, using different topics. Despite the negative opinion that information overload harms society intellectually, there are ancient topics and methods that can be used to sort useful information. There are two types of topics that information can be sorted into, organizing information and exploring common features in sets of information. The organizing of information helped with writing processes by sorting information into, “storehouses.” The second form of information is in sorting and determining common topics, or methods that information is related to. There are three special topics that are: deliberative, judicial and ceremonial. The internet was believed at first to make obtaining information easier, but it also presents challenges. The first of these challenges is determining if the information is valid and reliable. The second challenge is the quantity of information and sources, and these can be sorted by providing details, and looking for information in a particular time period. The next task is balancing professional opinions, length and depth of the information, and where the viewpoints are coming from. The article presents the action of sorting relevant information in a digital notebook. The article ends by revealing that writing is recursive, and the outcome of our writing is dictated by the work and effort we put into it.</p>
<p>In the article, “Research as an Exploratory Process” it discusses the research process and the importance of it in everyday life, not just for college students that are writing essays. It highlights that this process is not always set in stone, but that the processes of research may become malleable due to the task at hand. The article continues by revealing that college assignments differ from the majority, due to the guidelines and restrictions that teachers place upon students. Other research, such as studying a current political candidate, is completely based upon the information that the researcher seeks to find and there are no parameters. The article next focuses upon how strict the research question can be, depending on the length requirements of the article or essay. The research question and thesis can also change depending on the information that is available, and a researcher may need to adapt. The article also discusses the numerous search engines and tools that are available, and how a student or researcher can change these to fit the needs of their research. Even once information is found, it needs to be evaluated for realistic information and evidence, otherwise it could be fraudulent. Once information has been found, it can be sited and synthesized to promote an argument or point to an audience in any shape or form. The article closes by revealing the three definitions of information: information as knowledge, information as process, and information as thing.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3:</strong>
The book “Doing Academic Writing in Education : Connecting the Personal and the
Professional,” by Janet Richards and Sharon Miller explores the challenge of balancing personal
and professional writing styles in academic settings. They suggest that everyone has a personal
and an academic voice, and the book aims to help readers find balance between the two. The authors wrote the book because they couldn&rsquo;t find a suitable textbook for college students. The
goal is to assist readers in becoming skilled academic writers while retaining their personal
views. The preface details various ways to improve writing and encourages the reader to strive
for excellence. The 7 chapters cover topics such as professional narratives, different types and
purposes of academic writing, invention strategies, revision, editing, and tying everything
together. The ultimate goal of the book is to empower students to become confident and
professional academic writers while not suppressing their personal voice.</p>
<p>In the article “Writer Identity in Academic Writing” by V.M. Simandan, the use of
pronouns and writer identity in academic writing is analyzed. The video included in the article
examines five topics of academic writing. These topics include: whether all academic writing is
the same, what writer identity is, writer identity in hard sciences, writer identity in soft
knowledge, and writer identity in textbooks. The video explores the different ways pronouns are
used in academic writing and in professional settings. The article then goes on to examine the
impact of using &ldquo;I&rdquo; in academic writing, with six different roles the pronoun can play, such as
representative, guide, architect, researcher, opinion holder, or originator. The article debunks the
stereotype that academic writing is impersonal by emphasizing the growing use of personal
pronouns in academic writing, and encourages writers to utilize their writer identity to effectively
communicate their message.</p>
<p>In Corrine E. Hinton&rsquo;s article &ldquo;So You&rsquo;ve Got a Writing Assignment. Now What?&rdquo; the main focus is on how to tackle a challenging writing assignment. The author suggests not to
panic or delay when given the assignment, instead read the instructions thoroughly and
repeatedly, and keep referring to it while working on it. Next, determine the purpose of the
prompt and the intended audience. Check if the assignment requires an argument and consider
the evidence provided before deciding on the best approach. Finally, stick to formatting and style
guidelines, utilize available resources and don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask questions.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and Interviews&rdquo; by Dana
Lynn Driscoll, the author highlights the three main methods of primary research used in
first-year writing courses: observations, interviews, and surveys. These methods can be used to
gain knowledge about a topic and write meaningful texts. Observation can be applied to nearly
any topic, and the type of observation will depend on the research question. Interviews or
question-and-answer sessions with one or more individuals can provide in-depth knowledge on a
subject. Surveys, similar to interviews, allow for collecting information on a larger scale. By
utilizing all three methods, an informative text can be produced.</p>
<p><strong>Week 2:</strong>
The article “How to Read Like a Writer” by Mike Bunn looks into the process of
questioning and analyzing the author’s choices to better understand the writing process. These
questions may include “What is the author’s purpose for this piece of writing?” and “Who is the
intended audience?” Asking these questions helps the reader better understand the underlying
context of the writing. Additionally, by analyzing the author&rsquo;s choices and techniques, the reader
can apply those to their own writing and improve their own writing skills.</p>
<p>Ken Hyland and Feng Jiang of “Is academic writing becoming more informal?” discusses
the slow increase in the use of informal features in academic writing and suggests that it’s related to changing rhetorical practices. The use of informal features can help to strengthen the writer&rsquo;s
arguments by positioning themselves in relation to the ideas and readers. The article suggests that even though there is a slight rise in informality, the ratio of nouns and adjectives compared to verbs and pronouns, which are indicators of formality, is actually growing. It concludes that the increasing use of informal features in academic writing is a positive change as it helps to make the writing more engaging and accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>The article “Johnson Rules to live by,” discusses the effectiveness of grammar instruction
in improving writing skills. The national curriculum in England tasks students with underlining
relative clauses. The results of these tests are used to evaluate schools and sometimes force
reforms on them. The article notes that there is no evidence to suggest that this kind of teaching
helps young people learn to write. It suggests that grammar is much more and can be thought of
as a valuable cultural heritage, a mode of analytical thinking, or as a science. It encourages
students to consider grammar as a way to improve writing skills and not just as a set of rules to
follow. The article concludes that a potential solution is to make language analysis a requirement
in university English courses, and treat grammar as puzzles to solve.</p>
