  <p><strong>Becoming Effective Academic Writers</strong></p>
<p>Building a house requires a great deal of discipline, dedication, and work. It requires a solid foundation, careful planning and design, and the use of appropriate materials to create a finished product that is strong, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. Academic writing is very similar to building houses; it demands commitment and an attention to detail. Like many I found great difficulty in writing academic pieces. My essays lacked a cohesive structure, flow, and my arguments were often weak and not well-supported by evidence. My writing began to improve as I shifted my mindset and focus. Reading developer blogs and online articles as opposed to video led to a deeper understanding of the writing process and helped me identify and incorporate effective writing strategies. Since I started writing on my blog, I’ve begun to appreciate the work that goes into writing and understanding the process behind it.</p>
<p>To become effective academic writers, students must adopt the practice of reading like a writer, balance their interpersonal and professional writing, and utilize research to support their writing and arguments, avoiding any biases and preconceived notions. By taking these steps and continuously practicing their writing skills, students can develop the ability to produce well-crafted, rigorous academic writing that accurately conveys their ideas and supports their arguments. By doing this, students will approach their writing and research with a different perspective that will result in improved academic writing.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Like a Writer (RLW)</strong></p>
<p>Shifting one’s perspective in research and writing is no easy task. Bunn (2010) goes into detail the process in which an individual can achieve this. He outlines, “when you Read Like a Writer (RLW) you work to identify some of the choices the author made so that you can better understand how such choices might arise in your own writing.” Typically, when students engage in reading, their aim is to gain insight into the specific topic they are studying. However, RLW provides a new way to read that goes beyond simply understanding the surface of the subject. By employing this approach, students can gain a deeper understanding of the diverse methods and choices that authors make when writing. Armed with this understanding, students can incorporate these methods and decisions into their own academic writing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When we read like writers we understand and participate in the writing. We see the choices the writer has made, and we see how the writer has coped with the consequences of those choices . . . We “see” what the writer is doing because we read as writers; we see because we have written ourselves and know the territory, know the feel of it, know some of the moves ourselves.” (Moran, 1990, p. 61)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Bunn suggests that by asking questions and grasping the contextual background in their reading material, students can support themselves in their coursework. These inquiries pertain to the author’s purpose, their motives, and their intended audience. Bunn concludes that in doing so, students can better integrate their research and understand their assignment. Academic assignments will often ask to go beyond the surface of the subject matter, requiring students to not only cover a wide range of subjects but engage in informed analysis and have a strong understanding of the contextual background. Hinton also states that understanding the author’s purpose and their audience is crucial in academic writing. She claims that assessing knowledge is just one aspect of an assignment. Most of the time instructors are looking for a deeper understanding and application in their student’s academic writing. Audience and writer’s purpose are critical components to any writing assignment and lead to a much more comprehensive understanding of the material. “Analyzing the background (personal, educational, professional), existing knowledge, needs, and concerns of your audience will help you make more informed decisions about word choice, structure, tone, or other components of your paper” (Hinton, 2010, p. 23).</p>
<p><strong>Balancing Interpersonal and Professional Writing</strong></p>
<p>“A formal style is characterized by detachment, accuracy, rigidity and heaviness; an informal style is more flexible, direct, implicit, and involved, but less informative” (Heylighen &amp; Dewaele, 1999). As a result of this, Hyland &amp; Jiang (2014) state “students are frequently cautioned against informality as it conveys impressions of the author that may be unwelcome in academic writing” (Hyland &amp; Jiang, 2014, p. 41). The balance between the use of informal features and formality in academic writing is one that’s difficult to achieve, as finding the right combination of informal elements and formality can be challenging in academic writing. On one hand the use of informal features can help to strengthen the writer’s arguments by positioning themselves in relation to the ideas and readers. But on the other hand, it can also detract from the credibility of the writing if not used appropriately, as excessive informality can undermine the academic tone and professionalism of the piece. At the end of the day, it is the responsibility of the writer to balance the use of informal language in their writing based on the topic and intended audience.</p>
<p>Academic writing is not the uniformly faceless prose that it is often thought to be, but it displays peculiarities between fields of study” (Simandan, 2010). Simandan also claims the extent to which the author incorporates their personal involvement in the writing through the use of first-person pronouns varies between disciplines. He discusses how recent research is showing a trend that academic writing is changing with the writer’s presence being much stronger than previous academic writing styles. Students should not hesitate to add their personal touch to their academic work, but they should be mindful of the right balance between their identity and the standards of the field they are writing in. Hyland &amp; Jiang conclude that the increasing use of informal features in academic writing is a positive change as it helps to make the writing more engaging and accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p><strong>Conducting Research</strong></p>
<p>Research is one of the most important aspects of academic writing. It is the core of all academic work, and serves as the foundation for the writer&rsquo;s arguments and insights. It provides the writer with the necessary information and data to support their claims and perspectives, and helps to establish the credibility of the writing. Driscoll (2010) writes that primary research “is research that is collected firsthand rather than found in a book, database, or journal.” It is important for students to differentiate between various types of research as it can play a significant role in the validity and reliability of their academic writing. Primary research consists of observations, interviews, and surveys which can be used to gather first-hand information and data. These methods provide an opportunity for the researcher to collect data directly from the source, allowing for greater control and flexibility in the research process. It’s important for students to integrate primary research in their academic writing as it greatly strengthens their arguments and provides more credibility to their work.</p>
<p>“There is little point in collecting data and learning about something if you already think you know the answer! Bias might be present in the way you ask questions, the way you take notes, or the conclusions you draw from the data you collect” (Driscoll, 2010, p. 156). When conducting research make sure to take precautions to minimize any potential biases that might affect the validity of your results. This includes being open-minded and avoiding preconceived notions, clearly defining research questions, and ensuring that data collection methods are standardized and objective. Additionally, it’s important to critically evaluate the data and draw well-supported conclusions, rather than just confirming one’s own biases. By being mindful of potential biases, students can ensure that their research is rigorous and trustworthy, leading to a more credible and convincing piece of academic writing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to achieve success as an academic writer, students should adopt the habit of reading critically, strike a balance between personal and professional writing styles, and incorporate researched information to support their writing while avoiding any biases or pre-existing beliefs. By implementing these strategies and continuously honing their writing abilities, students can create strong, well-articulated academic writing that effectively conveys their thoughts and supports their arguments.</p>
