<p><strong>Costs and Benefits Associated with College</strong></p>
<p>The world around us puts in great value and pride in universities and college education. This influences many students to attend and graduate college. At the end of the day, students may not value the education they receive in college, but they will value their diploma. A sheet of paper that would normally have little or no value is given tremendous value. Only because of the perception and value society offers it. Because of society&rsquo;s values, the benefits of college often outweigh the costs. Graduating and attending college yields both financial and social benefits.</p>
<p>FINANCIAL</p>
<p>In “7 Compelling Reasons Why You Should Go To College,” Kumok and Hahn discuss that college graduates often receive benefits such as employment stability, paid vacation, and sick days. “Graduating with a college degree typically leads to more job security, which means you’re less likely to face unemployment” (Kumok and Hahn). Owen and Sawhill of “Why You Should Go to College” come to the same conclusion that “college graduates make significantly more money over their lifetimes than those with only a high school education.”</p>
<p>Education is often seen as an investment in these articles. In the TED Talk “How college loans exploit students for profit,” Samuel claims that education is an “investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work.” In “Should Everyone Go To College,” Jacobson writes that even if an individual doesn’t obtain a full four-year degree, they still gain great financial rewards in the labor market. Sawhill and Owen conclude that, after many studies, college is one of the greatest investments we can make. They introduced the Hamilton Project research, which shows investing in college provides a tremendous return. “Hamilton Project research shows that 23- to 25-year-olds with bachelor’s degrees make $12,000 more than high school graduates, but by age 50, the gap has grown to $46,5000” (Owen and Sawhill). This extremely large gap in financial output further reinforces the idea that education is an investment.</p>
<p>Samuel introduces this idea of Income-Based Tuition. “Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major” (Samuel). This idea was founded on educating users in order to counteract the deceptive sales pitches that colleges offer. Students be aware of the financial costs and benefits of a given major. Jacobson expounds upon this idea and introduces “net-price calculators.” These calculators provide a better perspective, which allows individuals to better estimate the real cost of attending college. In the hopes of this new found knowledge this would lead to students gaining a better understanding if their chosen field or institution is the right option for them.</p>
<p>Even though college may seem like a great investment to most, it’s not for everyone. “Even though attending college can offer numerous financial, health, and social benefits, no degree can guarantee these things” (Kumok and Hahn). Jacobson studies the Hamilton Project and finds that “lifetime earnings vary tremendously by major.” The costs of college may outweigh the benefits based on an individual&rsquo;s major. For most, college is incredibly beneficial, but for some, it may not be worth pursuing.</p>
<p>SOCIAL</p>
<p>“People with bachelor’s degrees tend to be happier than those without one” (Kumok and Hahn). They also find that college grads tend to have longer marriages compared to those with a high school education. This correlates with previous statement and would also contribute to increased happiness. “Research suggests that additional education improves overall wellbeing by affecting things like job satisfaction, health, marriage, parenting, trust, and social interaction” (Owen and Sawhill). Owen and Sawhill’s analysis of previous studies supports Kumok and Hahn’s conclusions that college graduates have increased happiness.</p>
<p>Kumok and Hahn find that higher education correlates with better health. They back this up by mentioning that “those with college degrees have greater access to health insurance” (Kumok and Hahn). They also find that higher income, which usually originates from college degrees, leads to safer housing and access to healthy food. Owen and Sawhill find that a college education leads to reduced crime rates and higher political participation</p>
<p>College increases your access and opens up additional opportunities to “pursue new passions and expand your worldview” (Kumok and Hahn). They discuss how college gives increased access to resources such as experienced professors and talented classmates. Through these resources, individuals can expand their network and broaden their minds. In the article “Hidden Intellectualism,” Graff touches on the hidden intellectualism behind passions. He found that the analysis of common passions such as sports teams and movies offered more academic benefits than common academic work. “I began to learn the rudiments of the intellectual life: how to make an argument, weigh different kinds of evidence, move between particulars and generalizations, summarize the views of others, and enter a conversation about ideas” (“Hidden Intellectualism” 294).</p>
<p>Graff believes that school institutions and the current structure of education can be greatly improved. “Schools and colleges might be at fault for missing the opportunity to tap into such street smarts and channel them into good academic work” (“Hidden Intellectualism” 291). Street smarts more thoroughly fills intellectual thirst than academic culture, which feels sterile and fake. Graff also finds that street smarts satisfy the thirst for community. He concludes that schoolwork isolates the individual from others around them. Samuel also believes in the value of “street smarts.” He hopes that people may rediscover “their love of learning &ndash; begin to study what they love, love what they study, follow their passion getting stimulated by their intelligence, follow paths of inquiry that they really want to” (Samuel).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>College education is heavily valued and promoted by society. Which leads to college graduates being granted additional job opportunities, employment stability, and increased income. For most, the social and financial benefits of attending college outweigh the costs. But one must consider that a college education isn’t for everyone. The individual must consider their circumstances in order to come to a conclusion whether college is right for them. Perhaps further research could be done on which fields of education yield the greatest benefits and the least. With that research in mind, people can make more informed decisions about college education.</p>
