  <p><strong>Final Essay</strong></p>
<p>The skills and knowledge gained from Communications 2110 can be extremely useful and applicable in daily life, as effective communication is a crucial aspect of building and maintaining personal and professional relationships. The course&rsquo;s emphasis on understanding the complexities of communication, including the influence of language, culture, and personal experiences, can help individuals to better navigate and understand the perspectives of others. The HURIER listening model and Tuckman&rsquo;s model of group development provide practical frameworks for improving listening and teamwork skills, respectively, which can be applied in a variety of settings. Overall, the lessons learned in Communications 2110 can help individuals to become more effective and empathetic communicators, leading to more fulfilling and successful personal and professional interactions.</p>
<p>The HURIER listening model is a framework designed to help individuals improve their listening skills and become more effective communicators. It stands for Hear, Understand, Respond, Interpret, Evaluate, and Respond.</p>
<p>To start, the first step in the HURIER model is to simply hear what the speaker is saying. This involves actively listening and paying attention to the words being spoken, as well as any nonverbal cues or body language. Next, the listener should strive to understand the meaning behind the words being spoken. This involves asking clarifying questions, paraphrasing, and seeking to understand the speaker’s perspective. Once the listener has a clear understanding of the message being conveyed, they should respond appropriately. This could involve offering feedback, asking follow-up questions, or simply nodding in acknowledgement. The fourth step in the HURIER model is to interpret the message. This involves considering the context in which the conversation is taking place, as well as any underlying emotions or motivations behind the words being spoken. The fifth step is to evaluate the message. This involves considering whether the information being conveyed is accurate, relevant, and useful. Finally, the listener should respond to the message in a way that is respectful, thoughtful, and appropriate. This could involve offering support, making a suggestion, or simply thanking the speaker for their time.</p>
<p>By following the HURIER listening model, I have learned how to: pay attention and focus on the speaker, ask clarifying questions, provide feedback and acknowledge the speaker, consider the context and underlying meaning, and critically evaluate the context of the message, and reflect the impact of the message. Overall, the HURIER listening model helps individuals to become more effective communicators by encouraging them to actively listen, understand, and respond to messages in a way that is respectful and appropriate. By following these steps, individuals can build stronger relationships and improve their communication skills.</p>
<p>After completing the “Why isn’t the Sky Blue,” assignment I’ve learned that the way we communicate and describe our perceptions through language allows us to share and understand experiences with others. Without a common language and vocabulary, it would be difficult to effectively communicate and understand each other&rsquo;s perceptions. I’ve learned that culture, personal experiences, and individual differences can influence our perception and interpretation of the world. It is important to consider these factors when trying to understand and communicate with others, as they can impact the way we perceive and understand reality. In addition, I learned the idea that society&rsquo;s collective perception can shape our understanding of reality. For example, the social construction of reality can change over time as new information becomes available and society&rsquo;s perception shifts.</p>
<p>This assignment opened my eyes and encouraged me to look at reality from a different perspective. In the process of completing the assignment I realized that we categorize our perceptions into words. Emotions, feelings, taste, smells, and colors are very difficult to describe. But once we assign these perceptions a word, it becomes very easy for everyone to understand. Without words assigned to these perceptions, our communication will be rendered ineffective. The fact is that the sky is only blue because we all agreed it is. I find that very idea fascinating and difficult to comprehend and absorb the full complexity. It is with great enthusiasm that I express my fondness for the most recent assignment. It has been my favorite of the course thus far.</p>
<p>Tuckman’s model, also known as the “stages of group development,” is a framework developed by psychologist Bruce Tuckman in 1965 to describe the stages that a group goes through as it forms and develops. The model includes four stages: forming, storming, norming, and performing.</p>
<p>The forming stage is characterized by uncertainty and a lack of structure, as group members are just getting to know each other and establishing roles. The storming stage is marked by conflict and disagreement as group members struggle to assert their own ideas and opinions. The norming stage is a period of cooperation and harmony, as group members begin to work together and establish ground rules. The performing stage is when the group is able to work together effectively and achieve their goals. The adjourning stage is the final stage, where the group disbands or completes their task.</p>
<p>When our group first got together, we were still figuring out a workflow that works for our group. We were very much in the forming stage. There was a lack of structure and communication during our first assignment. We divided up the assignment and distributed it among the group members. Everyone in the group took charge and completed our parts of the assignment that was previously assigned. Even though the assignment was a group assignment we went about it very individually with little to no communication efforts. This lack of coordination led to the failure to submit the assignment on time. The assignment was completed, but our group’s lack of communication led to the failure to realize that we didn’t submit the assignment. I believe that we went in with the mindset that the last person who completes their part will submit the assignment. We failed to communicate this mindset which led to an unsubmitted assignment. It wasn’t until the day after that we realized nobody submitted it. After this experience as a group we realized that we needed to communicate more often and effectively rather than making assumptions.</p>
<p>The group member role that best describes me I believe to be, the procedural technician. The procedural technician performs tasks on the behalf of the group.  One example of this is when we worked on the assignment “Communication Goes to the Movies,” we decided to submit a video online rather than presenting in class. I have experience with video editing and videography, so I suggested I can edit a video of our presentation. All the members of the group sent me their videos of them presenting their sections for the video. After receiving these videos, I edited them all together and normalized the audio. This is an example of me performing a task on the behalf of a group.</p>
<p>During our group CEL project we decided to point our community service towards the Season’s Assisted Old Folks home and the Feed My Starving Children program hosted at a church. I participated in attending both activities and I made sure to keep track of the time that we spent at each service and working on the project. At the Feed My Starving Children event I scooped soy and deposited it into bags. During my time at the Season’s Assisted Old Folks home I assisted in the conversations with the people there. After completing our community service I put together a slide in our presentation that discusses the problem that our community service is addressing. I then recorded my video presenting it, and later edited together a video of everyone else’s parts of the presentation. The process in completing our community service was very eye opening. I knew going into it about the problems with loneliness and depression in the Old Folks homes, but I didn’t realize the extent of it. I’ve realized that we may be conscious of the problems around us, but we often don’t understand the whole problem or the extent of it until the problem directly affects you.</p>
<p>By visiting the Season’s Assisted old folks home and spending time with the residents, volunteers may be able to address issues of loneliness and isolation that are common among elderly individuals. Playing games and engaging in other activities with the residents can provide socialization and mental stimulation, which can improve their quality of life. Participating in a food packaging event for Feed My Starving Children at a church helps address the problem of hunger and malnutrition in the community. By packaging and distributing food to those in need, volunteers can help ensure that people have access to the nutrition they need to lead healthy, active lives. Overall, these community service activities aim to improve the well-being of elderly individuals and those facing food insecurity, and to contribute to the overall health and vitality of the community.</p>
<p>After completing our community service, we were able to help ease these feelings by spending time with them and giving them something to do and people to talk to for a while. During this process one of the residents even mentioned that she feels as though she isn’t even living their own lives anymore while living in the Old Folks home, just with our few visits, we were able to  help give them a little more normalcy.  The second issue we addressed was hunger in children. To help fix this problem we package food for starving children. These meals were very simple to make and included all the ingredients needed. With everyone&rsquo;s help, we helped to feed 250,000 families.</p>
<p>Interpersonal communication refers to the exchange of information and ideas between individuals. In the context of making our CEL community service assignment, interpersonal communication plays a crucial role in the success of the presentation. We as a group communicated about the rubric and requirements of the presentation. In doing so members of the group were able to discuss their personal insight based on how to achieve the requirements of the presentation. During the development of the presentation our group members were able to support one another and provide feedback on each of our presentation slides. Towards the end of the presentation after reviewing the rubric, my group was able to discuss and realize that I made a mistake in reading the requirements which led to me missing a slide. After our discussion I was able to make adjustments and resolve the issue. Overall, effective interpersonal communication is essential when working with a small group and making a presentation. It helps the group members to coordinate their efforts, to support one another, and to build relationships that are crucial to the success of the presentation.</p>
<p>After completing and reflecting on this course, I was able to narrow down the most important communication concepts. It’s very difficult to determine the single most important communication concept, but after reviewing them I believe that active listening is one of the most important communication concepts. Active listening is the process of attentively and intentionally listening to another person’s words and ideas. It is an important communication concept because it helps us to understand the other person’s message and to respond in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>If the world were without active listening, communication would likely be less effective and more prone to misunderstandings. Without it, people might be more likely to misunderstand one another, or to respond in a way that is not-well suited to the speaker’s message. This could lead to confusion, conflict, and a breakdown in relationships. In addition, without active listening, people might be less able to learn from one another and to gain new insights and perspectives. This could hinder personal and professional development, as well as hind progress in society as a whole. Overall, a world without active listening would likely be a more chaotic and less cooperative place, with fewer opportunities for growth and understanding. Ultimately this is why I believe active listening to be one of the most important communication concepts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the skills and knowledge gained from Communications 2110 are highly useful and applicable in daily life. Effective communication is a vital aspect of building and maintaining personal and professional relationships, and the course&rsquo;s focus on understanding the complexities of communication, including the impact of language, culture, and personal experiences, can help individuals to better navigate and understand the perspectives of others. The HURIER listening model and Tuckman&rsquo;s model of group development provide practical frameworks for improving listening and teamwork skills, respectively, which can be applied in a variety of settings. By applying the lessons learned in this course, individuals can become more effective and empathetic communicators, leading to more fulfilling and successful personal and professional interactions.</p>
