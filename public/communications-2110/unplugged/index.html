I believe that technology should be used to assist daily life, never to replace it. My relationship with technology is somewhat complex. I utilize it creatively to make video games, animations, and videos. But I realize that even using it in these beneficial ways, it still needs balance. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of my life in front of a computer. I try to balance the time I spend in technology with other meaningful beneficial ways.">

<p><strong>Unplugged</strong></p>
<p>I believe that technology should be used to assist daily life, never to replace it. My relationship with technology is somewhat complex. I utilize it creatively to make video games, animations, and videos. But I realize that even using it in these beneficial ways, it still needs balance. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of my life in front of a computer. I try to balance the time I spend in technology with other meaningful beneficial ways. Technology shouldn&rsquo;t replace my face to face conversations and social interactions with people. It&rsquo;s helpful when I can&rsquo;t see the person in real life, but whenever I can, I will always prefer face to face communication. One example of how I use technology to assist my life, is whenever we go on family trips. I enjoy going on adventures and being outside with my family. While doing this I&rsquo;ll shoot handheld and 360 video and make a montage of the trip at the end. In this case technology isn&rsquo;t replacing my reactions in real life, but it&rsquo;s assisting it by creating these memories that we can look back on in the future. Balance is the key. I&rsquo;ve been trying to balance the things I make with technology with going outside and being in reality.</p>
